# Global HR & Geography Analytics using SQL

## Project Overview
This project performs **end-to-end SQL analytics** on the **Oracle HR schema** to derive insights related to **geography, workforce distribution, salary patterns, and career mobility**.  
The analysis demonstrates real-world SQL usage through **multi-table joins, aggregations, window functions, and business logic**.

This project is designed to reflect **industry-style SQL analysis** commonly expected in **Data Analyst interviews and take-home assignments**.
